# Postgres SQL For Fantasy Football

## This repo allows a user to merge data from different sources to develop an extensive query on their league's free agents. Currently, Reality Sports Online has a limited amount of data on each player, which is why I created this solution.

- The goal is to develop and identify good data sources to use for future seasons.
