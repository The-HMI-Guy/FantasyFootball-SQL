## General Info

### Currently, Reality Sports Online has a limited amount of data on each player, which is why I created this solution. I have proved the scripts needed to create each table. Once the tables have been created and data has been imported from the csv files, run the query to join the different data together.

- The goal is to develop and identify good data sources to use for future seasons.

## Technologies

- SQL: PostgresSQL
- Data Format: Comma-separated Values (CSV)
